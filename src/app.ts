// Main application logic will go here.
// This file could orchestrate different parts of the application,
// such as initializing services, loading data, and setting up the UI.

// For now, it mainly imports main.ts which handles the DOMContentLoaded and UI setup.
import './main';

console.log("App module loaded. Main execution starts in main.ts.");

// Future:
// - Initialize services (IndexedDB, PWA Service Worker registration)
// - Load initial configuration or user settings
// - Potentially handle routing if it's a more complex SPA not handled by ui-manager alone.
